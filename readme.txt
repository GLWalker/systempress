-- About Editor Scripts --
WordPress Block Editor (Gutenberg) APIs:

Hooks like wp.hooks.addFilter to modify or extend block behaviors.
Components like InspectorControls, PanelBody, and SelectControl for creating sidebar controls.
Higher-Order Components (HOCs) for injecting new functionality into existing blocks.
IIFE Structure (Immediately Invoked Function Expression):

The function (wp) { ... }(window.wp) structure encapsulates the script to avoid polluting the global scope while safely accessing the wp object.
Extensible Block Configuration:

Using filters (blocks.registerBlockType) to add attributes.
Leveraging higher-order components for editor UI changes (editor.BlockEdit).
Using save content hooks (blocks.getSaveContent.extraProps) to affect the final output.
